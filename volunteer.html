				<p class="description">Being a summer camp counselor at Phipps was one of the most rewarding experiences of my life.  I worked with children of various ages from June to August, and helped them learn about nature, science, and healthy living.  Not only was I contributing to the community, but I learned so many new things as well!  My time at Phipps was definitely rewarding!</p>
